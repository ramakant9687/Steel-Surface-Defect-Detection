# Steel-Surface-Defect-Detection
Classification of various Defects on Steel Surfaces using various ML models.

Steel is one of the most important building materials of modern times. Steel buildings are resistant to natural and man-made wear which has made the material ubiquitous around the world. To help make production of steel more efficient, this project  will help us to identify various defects present in steel surfaces while in production.

The production process of flat sheet steel is especially delicate. From heating and rolling, to drying and cutting, several machines touch flat steel by the time itâ€™s ready to ship. Today, Steel manufacturing industries uses images from high frequency cameras to power a defect detection algorithm.

This project will help engineers improve the algorithm by localizing and classifying surface defects on a steel sheet.

If successful, we'll be able to keep manufacturing standards for steel high, leading to a stronger, more efficient world all around us.
